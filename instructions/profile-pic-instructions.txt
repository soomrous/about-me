To use your own profile picture:
1. Save your profile picture as 'profile-pic.jpg' in the same folder as index.html
2. Make sure the image is square (400x400 pixels recommended) for best results
3. The image will automatically have the floating animation applied

Alternatively, you can:
- Name your image file differently and update the src attribute in index.html
- Use different image formats (PNG, JPEG, etc.)
- Resize the image using the CSS in style.css
